# Craiyon Finder
This program is an interface for easily getting images from the [Craiyon Image AI]https://www.craiyon.com/.  
This program is not an AI, it just outsources Craiyon.  

## Usage
The only library required is Selenium. If you don't have it then you can just run 'py -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade'
 in a terminal in the project directory.  
Run main.py and put in a prompt. You can type LIST to put in a list of prompts, all of which will get processed. Type END to finish the list. Your generated images can be found in ".\found\\[Prompt]"
